You know that thing where you're staring at a business problem at 2am and thinking *"there's probably a framework for this"*?

There are 523 of them. And now they live in your terminal.

**Founder Skills** gives you instant access to the best thinking from **Porter, Christensen, Reid Hoffman, Brian Balfour, Teresa Torres, Paul Graham**, and dozens more — as AI-powered slash commands that actually apply the frameworks to *your* specific situation. Not generic advice. Not Wikipedia summaries. Real analysis, with assumptions called out and recommendations you can test.

Works with **Claude Code**, **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, and any LLM.

> *"Like having McKinsey, YC, and a16z in your terminal, except they give you straight answers and don't charge $500/hr."*

---

## Quick Start

### Claude Code

**One command. That's it.**

```
/plugins marketplace TasteDotDev/FounderSkills
```

Install the `founder-skills` plugin when prompted. Done. You now have 16 slash commands and 523 frameworks.

Check what's installed anytime:

```
/plugins
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Prefer git clone?</strong></summary>

```bash
# Global install (all projects)
git clone https://github.com/TasteDotDev/FounderSkills ~/.claude/skills/founder-skills

# Project-only install
git clone https://github.com/TasteDotDev/FounderSkills .claude/skills/founder-skills
```

</details>

**Now try it:**

```
/founder We're a 50-person B2B SaaS doing $5M ARR, growth slowed from 3x to 1.5x
```

That's it. `/founder` figures out you need Four Fits + Growth Accounting + Unit Economics, applies all three to your situation, and gives you a prioritized action plan with validation steps. No framework selection needed.

---

## The `/founder` Command

`/founder` is the one command to rule them all. Describe any business problem in plain English and it will:

1. **Diagnose** what you're actually dealing with (not what you think you're dealing with)
2. **Select** the 2-4 best frameworks from 523 options
3. **Apply** each one with full rigor — every section, every dimension, no shortcuts
4. **Challenge** its own analysis (devil's advocate, assumption stress-test, pre-mortem)
5. **Synthesize** into a prioritized action plan with specific validation gates

```
/founder Should we pivot from B2C to B2B?
/founder I need to pitch investors for our Series A
/founder Our team is growing from 10 to 50, how should we restructure?
/founder Competitor just raised $100M and is undercutting our prices
/founder How will AI agents disrupt our industry in the next 3 years?
```

**The secret sauce:** Every analysis ends with an assumptions table and a "here's how to test this before committing" section. Because the honest answer to most strategy questions is *"it depends, and here's how to find out."*

## What Makes This Different

**It's not a chatbot that read a business book once.** Every framework has:

- A **structured expert prompt** — the AI adopts the mindset of a specialist in that exact domain
- **Required inputs** — it asks you the right questions, not generic ones
- **Full output structure** — every section, every dimension, no hand-waving
- **Assumptions audit** — every analysis surfaces what it assumed and how to validate it
- **Contrarian check** — the AI argues against its own recommendation to stress-test it

The result reads like something you'd get from a top-tier strategy consultant, except it's honest about what it doesn't know.

## Multi-Platform

Founder Skills works everywhere, not just Claude Code.

### OpenAI (GPTs & Assistants)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TasteDotDev/FounderSkills && cd FounderSkills
python3 build.py
```

| Platform | Instructions | Framework details |
|:---------|:------------|:-----------------|
| **GPTs** | `dist/openai/gpts/<category>/instructions.md` | Upload `knowledge/frameworks.md` as knowledge file |
| **Assistants** | `dist/openai/assistants/<category>.json` | Upload `files/<category>-frameworks.md` to vector store |

### Gemini (Gems & API)

| Platform | Instructions | Framework details |
|:---------|:------------|:-----------------|
| **Gems** | `dist/gemini/gems/<category>/instructions.md` | Upload `knowledge/frameworks.md` as knowledge file |
| **API** | `dist/gemini/api/<category>.md` (all-in-one) | Included inline |

### Standalone

Individual self-contained prompts at `dist/standalone/<category>/<framework>.md` — copy-paste into any LLM.

### Build it yourself

```bash
python3 build.py          # Build all platforms (640 files)
python3 build.py --clean  # Clean rebuild
```

<details>
<summary>Output structure</summary>

```
dist/
  openai/
    gpts/<category>/instructions.md + knowledge/frameworks.md
    assistants/<category>.json + files/<category>-frameworks.md
  gemini/
    gems/<category>/instructions.md + knowledge/frameworks.md
    api/<category>.md
  standalone/<category>/<framework-slug>.md
  manifest.json
```

</details>

## Under the Hood

Each skill has two files:

```
skills/strategy/
├── SKILL.md          # System prompt + framework catalog
└── frameworks.md     # Detailed expert prompts for each framework
```

**SKILL.md** is what runs when you invoke a slash command. **frameworks.md** is the deep reference the AI reads when applying a specific framework — expert persona, required inputs, output structure, origin attribution.

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

These frameworks come from decades of the best business thinking:

| Domain | Thinkers |
|:-------|:---------|
| **Strategy** | Michael Porter, Clayton Christensen, Reid Hoffman, Andrew Chen |
| **Growth** | Brian Balfour (Reforge), Sean Ellis, Wes Bush, Elena Verna |
| **VC / Startup** | Y Combinator, Sequoia, a16z, First Round, OpenView |
| **Product** | Teresa Torres, Rahul Vohra, Marty Cagan, Jeff Bezos |

| **AI** | Anthropic, OpenAI, a16z AI team, Kyle Poyar |
| **Psychology** | Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, Robert Cialdini |
| **Communication** | Barbara Minto, Chip & Dan Heath, Jonah Berger |

We built the prompts. They built the ideas. Credit where it's due.
