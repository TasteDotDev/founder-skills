# Founder Skills

**523 AI-powered business frameworks** for founders and product managers — strategy, finance, leadership, growth, and behavioral science.

Works with **Claude Code**, **OpenAI GPTs/Assistants**, **Gemini Gems/API**, and as **standalone prompts**.

Includes modern frameworks from **Reforge, a16z, Y Combinator, Sequoia, First Round Capital**, and growth leaders at **Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, Datadog, and Figma**. Plus AI-era frameworks for agent design, AI GTM, and AI pricing.

## Quick start

### Claude Code (recommended)

```bash
# Install as a Claude Code skill (works across all projects)
git clone https://github.com/TasteDotDev/FounderSkills ~/.claude/skills/founder-skills

# Or for a specific project only
git clone https://github.com/TasteDotDev/FounderSkills .claude/skills/founder-skills
```

Then use slash commands:

```
/founder We're a 50-person B2B SaaS doing $5M ARR, growth slowed from 3x to 1.5x
/strategy swot-analysis for a B2B SaaS entering the European market
/finance analyze unit economics for our marketplace startup
/innovation
```

### OpenAI (GPTs & Assistants)

```bash
# Generate platform-specific files
git clone https://github.com/TasteDotDev/FounderSkills
cd FounderSkills
python3 build.py
```

**GPTs**: Upload `dist/openai/gpts/<category>/instructions.md` as the GPT instructions and `knowledge/frameworks.md` as a knowledge file.

**Assistants API**: Use the config in `dist/openai/assistants/<category>.json` and upload `files/<category>-frameworks.md` to a vector store.

### Gemini (Gems & API)

**Gems**: Upload `dist/gemini/gems/<category>/instructions.md` as the Gem instructions and `knowledge/frameworks.md` as a knowledge file.

**API**: Use `dist/gemini/api/<category>.md` as the system prompt — it includes all framework details inline.

### Standalone

Individual framework prompts in `dist/standalone/<category>/<framework>.md` — self-contained, works with any LLM.

## The `/founder` master skill

[`/founder`](./skills/founder/SKILL.md) is your **AI business consultant**. Describe any business problem and it will:

1. **Diagnose** — identify the problem type, scope, and missing context
2. **Select** — pick the 2-4 best frameworks from 523 options across 15 categories
3. **Apply** — run each framework end-to-end with full structure, no shortcuts
4. **Synthesize** — combine insights into a prioritized action plan with timelines

```
/founder Should we pivot from B2C to B2B?
/founder I need to pitch investors for our Series A
/founder Our team is growing from 10 to 50, how should we restructure?
/founder Competitor just raised $100M and is undercutting our prices
/founder How will AI agents disrupt our industry in the next 3 years?
```

No need to know which framework to use. `/founder` handles that for you.

## Building multi-platform dist

```bash
python3 build.py          # Build all platforms
python3 build.py --clean  # Clean and rebuild
```

Output structure:

```
dist/
  openai/
    gpts/<category>/instructions.md + knowledge/frameworks.md
    assistants/<category>.json + files/<category>-frameworks.md
  gemini/
    gems/<category>/instructions.md + knowledge/frameworks.md
    api/<category>.md
  standalone/<category>/<framework-slug>.md
  manifest.json
```

Tagged releases on GitHub include pre-built `dist/` as a downloadable artifact.

## What's inside each skill

Every skill has two files:

```
skills/strategy/
├── SKILL.md          # Main skill — instructions + framework list
└── frameworks.md     # Detailed reference — expert prompts, inputs, when-to-use
```

- **SKILL.md** is what Claude loads when you invoke the skill. It contains the framework catalog and output standards.
- **frameworks.md** is the detailed reference that Claude reads when applying a specific framework. It contains the expert system prompt, required inputs, and origin attribution for each framework.
