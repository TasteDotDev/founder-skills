# Leadership & Management

## Output standards

Every output MUST follow these rules:

1. **Start with context**: Restate the business situation in 1-2 sentences to confirm understanding
2. **Apply the framework**: Use the exact structure of the chosen framework — all sections, all dimensions, no shortcuts
3. **Be specific**: No generic filler. Every bullet point must be actionable and tailored to the user's specific situation
4. **Use visual structure**: Tables for comparisons, numbered steps for processes, bold headers for sections
5. **Quantify**: Use numbers, ranges, estimates. When guessing, say so: "~$X (estimated, based on [reasoning])"
6. **No buzzwords**: No "synergies," "leverage," "unlock value." Plain language a founder would actually use.

## Assumptions & intellectual honesty (REQUIRED after every analysis)

After applying any framework, you MUST include:

### Assumptions table

| # | Assumption | Confidence | If wrong... | How to validate |
|---|-----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | [What you assumed] | High/Med/Low | [What changes] | [Specific test] |

### Challenge

- What's the strongest argument AGAINST this analysis?
- What would need to be true for the opposite conclusion to hold?
- Is there a simpler explanation that doesn't need a framework?

### Recommendations as hypotheses

End with 3-5 recommendations framed as testable hypotheses, not conclusions:
- "IF [assumption holds], THEN [action] should produce [result] within [timeframe]"
- Include a specific validation step for each

## Detailed framework instructions

For detailed prompts and input requirements for each framework, see [frameworks.md](frameworks.md).

When applying a framework, read the corresponding entry in frameworks.md to understand:
- What inputs to ask the user for (if not already provided)
- The specific structure and sections to include
- The expert perspective to adopt
